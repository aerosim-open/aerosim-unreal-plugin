# AeroSim Unreal Plugin

This repo contains the AeroSim Unreal plugin for connecting an Unreal Engine 5 project to the simulation. It uses the `aerosim-world-link` library to communicate with the simulation to load and control assets from the [AeroSim Unreal Asset Library](https://github.com/aerosim-open/aerosim-assets).

See the [AeroSim repo](https://github.com/aerosim-open/aerosim) for instructions on how to install and use this as a sim renderer.
